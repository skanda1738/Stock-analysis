# stock-analysis
## Overview
A quick overview of this project was to help Steve analyze a list of stocks in excel, by creating macros so that it is very easy for an end user, like Steven, to use and get data from. 
### Results
After running the original code and then refactoring, it allowed excel to pull all of our wanted data quicker, by performing less steps and achieving the same goal in a shorter time. 

As it can be seen in the image below, this is the macro running from the original code, which took a considerable more time than the refactored code.

After fully refactoring the code and enabling excel to pull all the same information, but with fewer steps, the time to pull all the data was significantly reduced, as it can be seen from the image below.
